« Wash and soak the arhar dal in 2 cups of water for ½ hour. Soaking the dal reduces the

whistle turn the heat down and cook on medium flame for 3 - 4 minutes. Turn off the
flame. Once the pressure ends open the lid and check if the dal is cooked or not and if it
requires some more water. If the dal is thick in consistency then add some water for the
desired flow.
« Cooking without Pressure Cooker - Drain out the water and boil dal with 5 -6 cups of
water, salt and turmeric in a pan. Once it starts to boil close the lid and turn the flame to
medium and simmer till the dal gets little mushy. Adjust the water according to your
desired consistency.
« Now move the dal to a serving bowl and begin tempering.
« Take ghee or clarified butter in a pan, heat it; add cumin seed. When the cumin seeds
begin to sputter add hing, dried red chilli, stir it and then add green chilli, ginger, garlic
and fry till golden brown.
« After few seconds add onions to it when its translucent add tomatoes to it.
« When the oil begins to separate add pinch of salt and red chili powder to it. Quickly stir
with a spoon and pour it over the dal and close the lid. Ensure that the red chilly powder
