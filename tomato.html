You are just five basic steps and 30 minutes away from enjoying the smoothest, creamiest,most tangy and delicious homemade tomato soup.

Follow my detailed instructions below to learn how to make the best tomato soup tonight!

<h3>Step 1 – Cook Tomatoes</h3>
1. First, melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a pot on medium-low heat. The butter should melt and
 slightly simmer, but not burn.
2. Next, add 2 bay leaves and fry them in the butter for a few seconds until lightly browned,
 but again, not burned.

If you live in India, you can also use 1 medium tej patta or 2 small tej patta instead of the bay leaves.
3. Add ½ teaspoon of finely chopped garlic and ⅓ cup of finely chopped onions to the pan, and stir.
4. Sauté and stir until the onions become translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.
5. Now add the fresh chopped tomatoes (500 grams, or 6 to 7 medium tomatoes), and a hearty pinch of salt to taste.
6. Mix well.
7. Cover and simmer on a low to medium-low heat until the tomatoes soften, about 8 to 10 minutes.
8. Stir occasionally and keep an eye on the consistency of the mixture. If the liquids dry up and 
the tomatoes begin to stick, then add a splash of water at a time and stir. 
But be sure to not add too much water or you’ll dilute the delicious flavors!

After the tomatoes have softened, remove from the heat and cool. Take out the bay leaves and discard.
<h3>Step 2 – Blending Tomatoes</h3>
9. Once the tomato mixture has cooled to a point that’s safe to work with, add it to a blender jar.
 You could also use an immersion blender.
10. Blend to a lovely smooth consistency to make the tomato soup puree. 
11. You have the option of straining the puree through a strainer for an even smoother soup,
 but this step isn’t necessary.
13. If you do choose to strain the puree, move a spoon through it so that everything is strained except the seeds. 
<h3>Step 3 – Simmering Soup Further</h3>
14. Pour the tomato puree back into the pot, and add 1 cup water. Stir and combine well.
 Depending on the consistency you prefer, you can add a little less or
  more water – taking care that the soup does not become very thick or watery and runny.
Note that instead of water you could also use homemade Vegetable Stock which will surely add more flavors to the soup.
15. Next, add 1 teaspoon of raw sugar or white sugar.
16. Mix the sugar in the tomato soup very well.
17. Simmer on low heat until the tomato soup becomes hot, but is not boiling.
18. Season with freshly crushed black pepper, and stir.

19. Turn off the heat and stir in, 1 to 2 tablespoons heavy cream, depending on desired richness.
20. Mix well, taste, and add more salt and pepper if needed.
<h3>Step 4 – Making Bread Croutons</h3>
21. When the cooked tomato mixture is cooling, you can make the bread croutons. Mix together ½ cup bread cubes,
 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 light pinch of salt and 1 to 2 pinches of freshly crushed black pepper in a baking tray. Toss to coat.
22. Bake in an oven preheated to 200 degrees Celsius (400 degrees Fahrenheit), for approximately 3 to 5 minutes.

Or, you can opt to toast the bread slices in a skillet until golden and then chop them into bite sized cubes.
23. I like to make one or two sides even darker for a bit more crunch.
<h3>Step 5 – Serving Tomato Soup</h3>
24. When you’re ready to enjoy, pour the hot tomato soup into bowls. Add the croutons directly on top of the soup, or serve on the side.

You can also garnish the tomato soup with a bit of freshly chopped parsley or coriander leaves (cilantro) or basil or mint sprigs.

This soup is great served fresh, but also keeps well in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 4 days.

Expert Tips
Use fresh and very ripe red tomatoes. Avoid using tomatoes which are unripe, as they’ll likely have a sour taste.
There is just the right balance of tanginess from the tomatoes and sweetness from the sugar and cream in this recipe. 
Be sure to follow the recipe precisely to make sure you don’t add too much of any one element and throw off this delicate ratio.
You can skip the onions in the soup if you prefer, but I highly recommend that you add the garlic.
Feel free to add celery stems or basil to the soup for even more flavor. For celery add 1 tablespoon of chopped celery with the tomatoes. 
To add basil, include 4 to 5 fresh basil leaves when the tomatoes are softened and cooked. Mix and simmer for a minute.
For a slightly thinner soup, you could add a bit more of water or vegetable broth. But do not make the soup watery or runny as the flavors and taste would go off balance.
