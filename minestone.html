    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    2 Tbsp olive oil (or another plant-based oil)
    1 onion, chopped
    2 carrots, peeled, chopped
    2 celery stalks, chopped
    2 garlic cloves, minced
    4 cups kale, stems chopped & reserved,
    leaves coarsely chopped (or 4 cups collard greens)
    1 russet potato, peeled, cubed
    1 (15 oz) can diced tomatoes
    1 fresh rosemary sprig (or 2 tsp dried rosemary)
    1 (15-ounce) can cannellini beans, drained, rinsed (low sodium preferable)
    6-8 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (or water)
    1-piece Parmesan cheese rind (low fat preferable)
    1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves and/or basil (optional)
    Salt and pepper to taste
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    1. Heat the oil in a heavy large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic.
    Sauté until the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the kale stems and potato; sauté for 5
    minutes.
    2. Add the tomatoes, kale leaves, and rosemary sprig. Simmer until the kale is wilted and the
    tomatoes break down, about 10 minutes.
    3. Meanwhile, blend 1/2 cup of the beans with 1/4 cup of the broth in a blender until almost smooth.
    Add the pureed bean mixture, remaining broth, and Parmesan cheese rind to the vegetable mixture.
    Simmer until the potato pieces are tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes.
    4. Stir in the whole beans and parsley. Simmer until the beans are heated through and the soup is
    thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.
    5. Discard Parmesan rind and rosemary sprig (the leaves will have fallen off of the stem.) Top with
    drizzle of oil and dusting of parmesan cheese.
    This will keep in the refrigerator 5-7 days, or in the freezer up to 3 months.
